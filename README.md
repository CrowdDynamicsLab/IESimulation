# Information Elicitation Simulations

# Usage
Use InfoElicitationSim.ipynb to run visualization
If plot does not render, try restarting Jupyter Notebook

# Structure
gen_vis.py contains visualization code

graph.py contains graph implementation and graph analysis functions

simualtion.py contains code to run actual simulations over graph

sim_interface.py contains code to generate IPython interface

InfoElicitationSim.ipynb contains the most relevant simulations, others are for testing specific ideas

Should be noted that simulations may be destructive on graph structure

# Shorter Term TODOs
* Test bipartite extrovert/introvert network (include heterogenous, unidirectional trans rates)
* Create time variant transmission rate
* Fix dirichlet time allocation

# Longer Term TODOs
* Edge creation for cost
* Capacity/utility decrease for crowding out effects
* Subjective utilities/incomplete information

# Simulation TODOs
* None for now
