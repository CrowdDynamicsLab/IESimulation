# Information Elicitation Simulations

# Usage
Use InfoElicitationSim.ipynb to run visualization
If plot does not render, try restarting Jupyter Notebook

# Structure
gen_plot.py contains visualization code
graph.py contains graph implementation and graph analysis functions
simualtion.py contains code to run actual simulations over graph

Should be noted that simulations may be destructive on graph structure

# TODO
* Add graphical interface for creating graphs
* More interesting simulation parameters
* More interesting graph parameters
* Add charts for showing change in utility over time
